This repo contains our final year project which which was DermAssistant a mobile based skin disease detection app.I have used MLOPS techniques to make this project scalable and automated.
# The following MLOPS techniques were used in this project:
# 1. DVC:
1.Versioning and Reproducibility: DVC allows you to version control your datasets, just like you version control your code with Git. It tracks changes to the dataset files, allowing you to easily switch between different versions and reproduce previous experiments.

2.Data Pipeline Management: DVC helps you manage complex data pipelines by defining dependencies and stages in your pipeline. It allows you to specify the input data, the processing steps, and the output data, ensuring that each step is executed in the correct order and only when necessary.

3.Storage Optimization: DVC provides features to optimize storage space when working with large datasets. Instead of storing multiple copies of the entire dataset, DVC uses a combination of hard links and symbolic links to efficiently manage data versions and minimize disk space usage.
